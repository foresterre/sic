# Changelog

sic is a CLI tool to (batch) process images and an [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image) front-end.
It can be used to convert between image formats and manipulate images using image operations.
It aims to include all primary [image](https://github.com/image-rs/image) functionality, and eventually also
support the most prominent [imageproc](https://github.com/image-rs/imageproc) manipulation routines.

The changelog below lists notable changes for [sic](https://github.com/foresterre/sic). It doesn't list most internal
changes.
